    Mode 0: Automatically scans the pic folder on the SD card, sorts the filenames alphabetically, and displays them sequentially.
    Mode 1: Automatically scans the pic folder on the SD card, displays images in the order they are found (unsorted).
    Mode 2: Uses a user-created fileList.txt file with custom paths to images. No file limit, allowing for a large collection of images.
